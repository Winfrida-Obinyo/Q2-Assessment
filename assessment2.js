// **African Cuisine:** You're creating a recipe app specifically for African cuisine.
// The app needs to handle recipes from different African countries, each with its
// unique ingredients, preparation time, cooking method, and nutritional
// information. Consider creating a `Recipe` class, and think about how you might
// create subclasses for different types of recipes (e.g., `MoroccanRecipe`,
// `EthiopianRecipe`, `NigerianRecipe`), each with their own unique properties and
// methods.


// input
// Recipes
// output
// Different types of recipes
// Process
// Creating a class known as Recipe ans pass in the attributes
// create sublasses and pass in unique properties

    // **Ancestral Stories:** In many African cultures, the art of storytelling is passed
    // down from generation to generation. Imagine you're creating an application that
    // records these oral stories and translates them into different languages. The
    // stories vary by length, moral lessons, and the age group they are intended for.
    // Think about how you would model `Story`, `StoryTeller`, and `Translator`
    // objects, and how inheritance might come into play if there are different types of
    // stories or storytellers.

//   Input

//   Ancestral Stories
//   output

// **Wildlife Preservation:** You're a wildlife conservationist working on a
// program to track different species in a national park. Each species has its own
// characteristics and behaviors, such as its diet, typical lifespan, migration
// patterns, etc. Some species might be predators, others prey. You'll need to create classes 
// to model `Species`, `Predator`, `Prey`, etc., and think about how
// these classes might relate to each other through inheritance.

// input

// creating  class and pass in the attributes
// creating subclasses

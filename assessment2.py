#  **African Cuisine:** You're creating a recipe app specifically for African cuisine.
#  The app needs to handle recipes from different African countries, each with its
#  unique ingredients, preparation time, cooking method, and nutritional
#  information. Consider creating a `Recipe` class, and think about how you might
#  create subclasses for different types of recipes (e.g., `MoroccanRecipe`,
#  `EthiopianRecipe`, `NigerianRecipe`), each with their own unique properties and
#  methods.
